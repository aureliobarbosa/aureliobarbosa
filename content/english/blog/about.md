Hello, I'm Marco Barbosa. Physicist exchanging career to Software Engineer.

My current goal is to use software engineering techniques such Test-driven Development (TDD) and Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) to improve scientific softwares and workflows. To achieve this goal I have being actively developing applications and participating on open source communities of the PyData Ecosystem (Python, Numpy, pandas, among others). I also teach and mentor students to improve their problem solving capabilities using programming languages such as C and Python.

I currently work as a professor and researcher at [University of Brasilia](https://www.unb.br), campus [UnB Planaltina](https://fup.unb.br). If you are interested about my academic activities, you can look into the *Academic* menu above, which includes Research, Education, and Mentoring.

I've created this website to discuss topics on the intersection between scientific research and software development; and 
also to promote my current and past activities. My original intention is to write here twice a month and to publish those contents on Linkedin and Medium.

If you want to enhance your numerical computing capabilities or scientific workflow, <!--see the projects on my portfolio, check my CV --> please contact me through [e-mail](mailto:aureliobarbosa@gmail.com) or on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-barbosa-196638234/).
