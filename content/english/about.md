Hello, I'm Marco Barbosa. Physicist exchanging career to Software Engineer.

My current goal is to use software engineering techniques such Test-driven Development (TDD) and Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) to improve scientific softwares. To achieve this goal I have being actively developing 
applications and participating on open source communities of the PyData Ecosystem (Python, Numpy, pandas, among others). I also teach and 
mentor students to evolve their problem solving capabilities using programming languages such as C and Python.
