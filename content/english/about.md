Hello, I'm Marco Barbosa. 

Here you will find posts about current and past activities including research projects, lectures, and the contents of my courses (mostly in portuguese).

My current goal is to use software engineering techniques such Test-driven Development (TDD) and Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) to improve scientific softwares. To achieve this goal I have being developing and actively participating open source communities of the PyData Ecosystem (Python, Numpy, pandas). I also teach and 
mentor students to solve problems using the programming languages languages C and Python.

If you are interested in debating or discussing any of these topics, feel free to contact me on Linkedin or just send an e-mail.

*Academic Career*

I obtained my Ph.D. in Physics from University of São Paulo in 2008 and since 2010 I have been working as a professor at  [University of Brasília](https://www.unb.br), at the campus [UnB Planaltina](https://fup.unb.br).

My original area of scientific research is statistical physics, and I did investigate systems at the interface between physics and chemistry. My previous academic work was done mostly investigating properties of water (or systems that may resemble it),models for drug delivery, and polymers.

In order to solve problems on these subjects it was typically necessary to develop softwares and 'code' in either C or  Python, and it  was also common to use scripts linux/unix shell and gnuplot (not to mention Maple).
