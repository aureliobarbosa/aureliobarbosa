Hello, I'm Marco Barbosa.

TL;DR Physicist turned into Software Engineer.

My current goal is to use software engineering techniques such Test-driven Development (TDD) and Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) to improve scientific softwares. To achieve this goal I have being developing and actively participating open source communities of the PyData Ecosystem (Python, Numpy, pandas). I also teach and 
mentor students to solve problems using the programming languages languages C and Python.

If you want to improve your numerical or scientific workflow, contact me through [e-mail](mailto:aureliobarbosa@gmail.com) or on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-barbosa-196638234/).

In this page you will find information on current and past activities.

## Academic Career
***

I obtained my Ph.D. in Physics from University of São Paulo in 2008 and since 2010 I have been working as a professor at  [University of Brasília](https://www.unb.br), at the campus [UnB Planaltina](https://fup.unb.br).

My original area of scientific research was statistical physics and physical chemistry, where I did investigate systems at the interface between physics, chemistry and molecular biology, with students and colleagues in science. Together we have done works involving the properties of liquid water (or systems that could resemble it), models for drug delivery, proteins and polymers. 

It turn it out that, to solve problems on these subjects we needed a lot of code: it was typically necessary to develop software using either C or Python, create lots of scripts to run them on Beowulf clusters with Linux/Unix shell, 
graphics were prepared using gnuplot, not to mention symbolic calculations were done using Maple.

Software engineering eventually appeared at this point to improve the scientific workflow and became a major subject.
