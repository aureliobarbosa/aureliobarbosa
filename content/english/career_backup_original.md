I finished a bachelor in Physics and got habilitated in Computational Physics, both on University of Brasilia, Brazil, in 2003. Then I moved to São Paulo and obtained my Ph.D. in Physics from University of São Paulo in 2008, and did work as postdoc researcher at University of Brasilia and Cornell. Since 2010 I have been working as a professor at [University of Brasília (UnB)](https://www.unb.br), campus [UnB Planaltina](https://fup.unb.br). As a professor I lectured and advisored students on Master in Materials Science (2011-2021), and also co-advisored students on other institutions (Physics Institutes on both University of Brasilia and Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul). I also lecture physics, basic chemistry and computation to undegraduates from major degrees in Natural Sciences and Environment Management, at UnB Planaltina. Besides, I got involved in various science outreach and science diffusion projects, mentored more than 20 undergreaduate students, work as Coordinator for Exact Sciences (that is alternative designation for Department Chair)
for a 2 years mandate, and participate in various administrative tasks.

My original area of scientific research was statistical physics and physical chemistry, particularly investigating systems at the interface between physics, chemistry and molecular biology, with students and colleagues in science. Together we have done works involving the properties of liquid water (or systems that could resemble it), models for drug delivery, proteins and polymers. 

It turn it out that, to solve problems on these subjects we needed a lot of code: it was typically necessary to develop software using either C or Python, create lots of scripts to run them on Beowulf clusters with Linux/Unix shell, 
graphics were prepared using gnuplot, not to mention symbolic calculations were done using Maple.

Software engineering eventually appeared at this point to improve the scientific workflow and became a major subject.
